if player mirrored, it means the enemy must be to his left
else it means the enemy must be to his right
when attacking , make sure if youre mirrored and if so make sure you dont hit if the enemy is behind

Stagger:
stagger on each strike with like 80% stagger chance will keep the game interesting, as soon as the enemy has no stagger he will attack with 50% stagger
crit will stagger for longer and move the enemy back with a red glow on hhim

OR

enemy will run away slowly and we can hit him, but every randomized time the enemy will stop and cast a spell which we will need to run away
cuz it will do tons of damage
